foreground #e0def4

#: the foreground and background colors.

background_opacity 0.97

#: the opacity of the background. a number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. this will only work if
#: supported by the os (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: x11). note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. but it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. if you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

#: path to a background image. must be in png format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. the value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped or centered.

# background_image_linear no

#: when background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: how much to tint the background image by the background color. this
#: option makes it easier to read the text. tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. this option applies only
#: if background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported
#: or background_image is set.

# background_tint_gaps 1.0

#: how much to tint the background image at the window gaps by the
#: background color, after applying background_tint. since this is
#: multiplicative with background_tint, it can be used to lighten the
#: tint over the window gaps for a *separated* look.

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: how much to dim text that has the dim/faint attribute set. one
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: the foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.
